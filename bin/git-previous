# Get the previous Nth revision of a file. Like a HEAD~N but for a file instead of a branch
#
# Usage:
# git previous <N> [file]
# - N is the number of revisions to go back
# - file can be omitted, then you would be looking at the Nth last change in repo.
#
# ie. 'git previous 2 fileA' would give the return the SHA for the version of the file two changes ago.
# Most commonly, you would want to use N=1 to get the last file version for reverting
